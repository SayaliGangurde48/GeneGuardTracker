## 💡 Inspiration / Problem Statement

> “Genetics loads the gun, lifestyle pulls the trigger.”

- **60% of diseases are genetically inherited**, yet most individuals don’t know their family health history.
- In rural India, **lack of awareness and language barriers** make early diagnosis difficult.
- **Doctors lack tools** to quickly assess family history for preventive care.
- GeneGuard provides an AI-powered solution to **predict, educate, and prevent** hereditary diseases in an accessible way.
