## 🚀 Project Description

**GeneGuard** is a smart AI-powered web platform that helps users understand their **genetic health risks** by building a **multi-generational family health tree**. It empowers individuals to take **preventive health actions** with personalized recommendations and generates a **downloadable Health Passport**.  
This platform is designed to bridge the health awareness gap, especially in **rural and underserved communities**, with a **multilingual** and **easy-to-use interface**.

## 💡 Inspiration / Problem Statement

> “Genetics loads the gun, lifestyle pulls the trigger.”

- **60% of diseases are genetically inherited**, yet most individuals don’t know their family health history.
- In rural India, **lack of awareness and language barriers** make early diagnosis difficult.
- **Doctors lack tools** to quickly assess family history for preventive care.
- GeneGuard provides an AI-powered solution to **predict, educate, and prevent** hereditary diseases in an accessible way.
