Build a full-stack web prototype called GeneGuard – Smart Genetic Risk Tracker. The goal is to provide users with a tool to build a family medical history tree, assess genetic risk using AI logic, and receive personalized health insights.
🔧 Use the following stack:

    Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS for styling, React Router for navigation.

    Backend (simulate if needed): Node.js or mock APIs with in-memory state.

    Libraries:

        recharts for risk visualization

        qrcode.react for QR generation

        html2canvas or jsPDF for health passport PDF export

        uuid for generating unique user/family IDs

        react-i18next for multilingual support

🧩 Features to Build:
1. Landing Page

    Clean intro section with logo, tagline: “Track Genetic Risks. Empower Preventive Health.”

    Language selection dropdown (simulate 2–3 options: English, Hindi, Bengali)

    “Get Started” → leads to profile setup

2. User Profile Setup

    Collect:

        Name, Age, Gender

        Medical History: diabetes, cancer, heart disease, etc.

        Lifestyle habits (smoking, diet, exercise level)

3. Family Tree Builder

    Allow adding multiple family members with:

        Name, age, relation, medical history

        Lifestyle factors

    Display in visual format:

        Use a card-based layout for each member

        Optionally use drag-and-drop or collapsible tree structure (mock if limited)

4. Risk Analysis Engine (Mock AI)

    Use simple scoring rules:

        For example: if 2+ first-degree relatives have diabetes → mark as “High Risk”

    Generate scores for:

        Diabetes | Heart Disease | Cancer | Other hereditary conditions

    Display scores visually:

        Use bar or pie charts

        Color-coded: Red = High, Orange = Medium, Green = Low

5. Personalized Recommendations

    Based on risk:

        Lifestyle tips (e.g., “Increase fiber intake”, “Annual cancer screening recommended”)

        Screening schedules

        Doctor consultation prompts

    Add a card-based layout with icons and short descriptions

6. Health Passport Generator

    Let users export key data as a PDF

        Name, risks, family tree summary, recommendations

    Include a QR Code that links to a mock URL or report

        Use qrcode.react library

    Add option to Print or Download

7. Doctor Sharing View

    Create a page that simulates a doctor’s view:

        Show user’s summary with risk and family health map

        Include QR code and health history in one view

        Add a “share digitally” mock button (copy link, download)

8. Settings & Multilingual Support

    Language preference (simulate at least 2 languages)

    Account settings (mock only)

    Option to export/delete data

🔐 Privacy & Security Simulations

    Add toggles for “Data Privacy” (simulate with checkboxes)

    Use mock authentication screen (no real login needed)

💡 Bonus Innovative Ideas to Add:

    ✅ Preventive To-Do List: Auto-generated based on risk (e.g., “Book eye exam”, “Consult dietician”)

    ✅ Family Timeline View: Scrollable timeline showing major health events by family member

    ✅ Mock AI Chatbot: Simulate a chatbot (hardcoded Q&A) that answers user health queries

✅ Final Touches for Judges:

    Clean, responsive design (mobile-first)

    Use color themes that imply health & trust (e.g., soft greens, blues)

    Navigation bar or sidebar for easy flow: Home | Tree Builder | Risk | Passport | Share | Settings

    Ensure user flow matches the PDF diagrams:

        Step-by-step: onboarding → profile → family tree → risk → recommendation → passport → share
